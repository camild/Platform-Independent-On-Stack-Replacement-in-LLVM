\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed an OSR framework that combines the advantages of different previous OSR techniques that no previous solution provides simultaneously.


%, without resorting to native code manipulation or special instrinsics of the intermediate level.
Our solution combines in a unifying framework the advantages of different previous OSR techniques that no previous solution provides simultaneously.


scheme for encoding OSR machinery using high-level language constructs. 

%our continuation function is specialized for a given OSR landing pad and allows extensive optimizations.
