\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed a combination of features of extant OSR techniques that no previous solution provided simultaneously. Relevant aspects include platform independence~\cite{lameed2013modular}, generation of highly optimized continuation functions~\cite{fink2003design}, and direct support for JIT-based deoptimization without the need for interpreter to fall back into.
