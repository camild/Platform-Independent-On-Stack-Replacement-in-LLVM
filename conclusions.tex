\section{Conclusions}
\label{se:conclusions}

In this paper, we have proposed a combination of features of extant OSR techniques that no previous solution provided simultaneously. Relevant aspects include platform independence, generation of highly optimized continuation functions, and independence of a fallback interpreter.

%our continuation function is specialized for a given OSR landing pad and allows extensive optimizations.
