MATLAB is a popular dynamic language for scientific and numerical programming. Introduced in the late 1970s mainly as a scripting language for performing computations through efficient libraries, it has evolved over the years into a more complex programming language with support for high-level features such as functions, packages and object orientation. A popular feature of the language is the {\tt feval} construct, a built-in higher-order function that enable the invocation of the function passed as first argument on the remaining arguments for the feval, and to return the computed values. This feature is heavily used in many classes of numerical computations, such as iterative methods for the approximation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations and simulated annealing heuristics to locate a good approximation to the global optimum of a function in a large search space.
