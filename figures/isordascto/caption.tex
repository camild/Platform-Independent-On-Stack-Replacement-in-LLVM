\label{fig:isordascto} Faster variant of {\tt isord} in LLVM IR with comparator inlining, instrumented as OSR continuation function (\myfigure\ref{fi:isord-example}). Instrumentation additions are in grey. The original function entry block is unreachable after instrumentation and is eliminated (struck-through code fragments).
