\label{fig:isordascto} Faster variant of {\tt isord} (\myfigure\ref{fi:isord-example}) in LLVM IR with comparator inlining, instrumented as OSR continuation function. Instrumentation additions are in grey. The original function entry block is unreachable after instrumentation and is eliminated (struck-through code fragments).
