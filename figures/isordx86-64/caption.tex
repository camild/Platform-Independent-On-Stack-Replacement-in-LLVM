\label{fig:isordx86-64} OSR-instrumented functions {\tt isordfrom} (base) and {\tt isordascto} (faster continuation) after x86-64 lowering in LLVM. For the sake of comparison with the original non-OSR versions, additions resulting from the IR instrumentation are in grey, while removals are struck-through.
