\section{Artifact Description}

\subsection{Abstract}

\osrkit\ is a library that enables On-Stack Replacement (OSR) at arbitrary places in LLVM IR code. The artifact is designed to explore how \osrkit\ can instrument IR code to support OSR transitions in the LLVM MCJIT runtime environment. A running example is presented based on the \texttt{isord} case study discussed in Section 3. We also support repeating experiments Q1, Q2, and Q3 presented in Section 5. The artifact includes an interactive VM called \tinyvm\ for loading, inspecting, instrumenting, and executing IR code. The package is a preconfigured Oracle VirtualBox VM.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Description}

The main component of the artifact is an interactive VM called \tinyvm\ built on top of the LLVM MCJIT runtime environment and the \osrkit\ library. The VM provides an interactive environment for IR manipulation, JIT-compilation, and execution of functions either generated at run-time or loaded from disk: for instance, it allows the user to insert OSR points in loaded functions, run optimization passes on them, display their CFGs, and repeatedly invoke a function for a specified amount of times. \tinyvm\ supports dynamic library loading and linking, and includes a helper component for MCJIT that simplifies tasks such as handling multiple IR modules, symbol resolution in presence of multiple versions of a function, and tracking native code and other machine-level generated objects such as Stackmaps.

\tinyvm\ is located in {\small\tt /home/osrkit/Desktop/tinyvm/} and runs a case-insensitite command-line interpreter:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
osrkit@osrkit-AE:~/Desktop/tinyvm$ tinyvm
Welcome! Enter 'HELP' to show the list of commands.
TinyVM> 
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent Use ``help'' to print basic documentation on how to use the shell. Usage scenarios are discussed in \ref{ss:art-eval-res}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Installation}

To install the artifact, just import the appliance in Oracle VirtualBox, which installs Linux LXLE. Open the {\tt README} file on the {\tt Desktop} folder for further info on the artifact and the Linux distribution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment Workflow}

We propose two usage sessions. In the first session, we show how to generate and instrument an LLVM IR code based on the \texttt{isord} example presented in \mysection\ref{se:osr-llvm}. The second session focuses on how to run the scripts used to generate the performance tables of \mysection\ref{se:experiments} related to questions Q1, Q2, and Q3. Question Q4 is based on additional third-party software (the MATLAB McVM runtime) and is not addressed in the artifact.
