\subsubsection{Session 3: {\tt feval} optimization in McVM}

McVM is a virtual machine for MATLAB developed at McGill University. As a by-product of our project, we ported it from the LLVM legacy JIT to MCJIT, and later extended it with a new specialization mechanism for {\tt feval} calls. The source code for this version is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/dcdelia/mcvm}.
